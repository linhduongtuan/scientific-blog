# Testing Scientific Content Features

This post demonstrates all the advanced content features available in our scientific blog platform.

## Mathematical Formulas

Inline math: The famous equation $E = mc^2$ demonstrates mass-energy equivalence.

Display math for complex expressions:

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u$$

## Tables

Performance comparison across different models:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| ResNet-50 | 94.2% | 93.1% | 95.3% | 94.2% |
| DenseNet-121 | 95.7% | 94.8% | 96.1% | 95.4% |
| Vision Transformer | **96.3%** | **95.9%** | **96.7%** | **96.3%** |

## Code Blocks

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def gaussian(x, mu, sigma):
    return np.exp(-0.5 * ((x - mu) / sigma)**2) / (sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))

x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 1000)
y = gaussian(x, 0, 1)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Gaussian Distribution")
plt.show()
```
